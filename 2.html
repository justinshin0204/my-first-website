<h1>CSS</h1>

Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously,
 which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything
 is now CSS without a version number.
